# Hospital Simulation Project

## Overview

This project simulates the workflow of a hospital emergency department (ED) and an acute care unit (ACU) using the SimPy simulation library. It models the arrival of patients, their registration, triage, and subsequent assessments by either an ED doctor or an ACU doctor based on a probabilistic branching.

## Files

- `simulation.py`: Contains functions for generating patients and their activities within the simulation.
- `main.py`: Entry point for running the simulation. Sets up the simulation environment, resources, and parameter values.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- SimPy library


1. Install SimPy library:

   ```bash
   pip install simpy


## How to Run

To run the simulation, execute `main.py`:

```bash
python main.py
